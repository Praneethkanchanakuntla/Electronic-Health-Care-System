            <h4>Overview</h4>
        </i>
        <p>
            Hepatitis means inflammation of the liver. The liver is a vital organ that processes nutrients, filters the
            blood, and fights infections. When the liver is inflamed or damaged, its function can be affected. Heavy
            alcohol use, toxins, some medications, and certain medical conditions can cause hepatitis.

            Hepatitis is most often caused by a virus. In the United States, the most common types of viral hepatitis
            are hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Although all types of viral hepatitis can cause similar
            symptoms, they are spread in different ways, have different treatments, and some are more serious than
            others.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus. When someone is first infected with the
            hepatitis C virus, they can have a very mild illness with few or no symptoms or a serious condition
            requiring hospitalization. For reasons that are not known, less than half of people who get hepatitis C are
            able to clear, or get rid of, the virus without treatment in the first 6 months after infection.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most people who get infected will develop a chronic, or lifelong, infection. Left untreated, chronic
            hepatitis C can cause serious health problems including liver disease, liver failure, liver cancer, and even
            death.
        </p>
        <h4>Symptoms</h4>
        <p>Many people with hepatitis C do not have symptoms and do not know they are infected. If symptoms occur, they
            can include: yellow skin or eyes, not wanting to eat, upset stomach, throwing up, stomach pain, fever, dark
            urine, light-colored stool, joint pain, and feeling tired. If symptoms occur with a new infection, they
            usually appear within 2 to 12 weeks, but can take up to 6 months to develop.</p>
        <p>A blood test called a hepatitis C antibody test can tell if you have been infected with the hepatitis C
            virusâ€”either recently or in the past. If you have a positive antibody test, another blood test is needed to
            tell if you are still infected or if you were infected in the past and cleared the virus on your own.</p>

            <h4>How is hepatitis C spread?</h4>
        </strong>
        <i>
            <p>The hepatitis C virus is usually spread when someone comes into contact with blood from an infected
                person. This can happen through:</p>
        </i>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Sharing drug-injection equipment.</strong>
                <p>Today, most people become infected with hepatitis C by sharing needles, syringes, or any other
                    equipment used to prepare and inject drugs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Health care exposures.</strong>
                <p>Although uncommon, people can become infected when health care professionals do not follow the proper
                    steps needed to prevent the spread of bloodborne infections.</p>
            </li>
            <li> <strong>Sex with an infected person.</strong>
                <p>While uncommon, hepatitis C can spread during sex, though it has been reported more often among men
                    who have sex with men.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sharing personal items.</strong>
                <p>People can get infected from sharing glucose monitors, razors, nail clippers, toothbrushes, and other
                    items that may have come into contact with infected blood, even in amounts too small to see.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Blood transfusions and organ transplants.</strong>Before widespread screening of the blood
                supply in 1992, hepatitis C was also spread through blood transfusions and organ transplants.</li>

        </ul> <strong>
            <h5>Testing and Diagnosis</h5>
        </strong>
        <i>
            <p>CDC now recommends universal hepatitis C screening for all U.S. adults and all pregnant women during every pregnancy, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is 0.1% This includes</p>
        </i>
        <ul>
            <li> All adults aged 18 years and older</li>
            <li>All pregnant women during each pregnancy</li>
            <li>People who ever injected drugs and shared needles, syringes, or other drug preparation equipment, including those who injected once or a few times many years ago</li>
            <li>People with HIV</li>
            <li>People who have ever received maintenance hemodialysis</li>
            <li>Liver failure</li>
        </ul>
