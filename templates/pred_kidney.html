            <h4>Overview</h4>
        </i>
        <p>
            Acute kidney failure occurs when your kidneys suddenly become unable to filter waste products from your blood. When your kidneys lose their filtering ability, dangerous levels of wastes may accumulate, and your blood's chemical makeup may get out of balance.
        </p>

        <p>
            Acute kidney failure — also called acute renal failure or acute kidney injury — develops rapidly, usually in less than a few days. Acute kidney failure is most common in people who are already hospitalized, particularly in critically ill people who need intensive care.
        </p>

        <p>
            Acute kidney failure can be fatal and requires intensive treatment. However, acute kidney failure may be reversible. If you're otherwise in good health, you may recover normal or nearly normal kidney function.
        </p>
        <h4>Symptoms</h4>
        <strong>Signs and symptoms of acute kidney failure may include:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Decreased urine output, although occasionally urine output remains normal</li>
            <li>Fluid retention, causing swelling in your legs, ankles or feet</li>
            <li>Shortness of breath</li>
            <li>Cold sweat</li>
            <li>Fatigue</li>
            <li>confusion</li>
            <li>Weakness</li>
            <li>irregular heartbeat</li>
            <li>Chest pain or pressure</li>
            <li>Seizures or coma in severe cases</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>
            <h4>Causes</h4>
        </strong>
        <p>Acute kidney failure can occur when:</p>
        <ul>
       <li> <p>You have a condition that slows blood flow to your kidneys.</p> </li>
       <li><p>You experience direct damage to your kidneys</p></li>
       <li><p>Your kidneys' urine drainage tubes (ureters) become blocked and wastes can't leave your body through your urine</p></li>
    </ul>    <strong>
            <h5>Impaired blood flow to the kidneys</h5>
        </strong>
        <i><p>Diseases and conditions that may slow blood flow to the kidneys and lead to kidney injury include:</p></i>
       <ul>
           <li> Blood or fluid loss</li>
<li>Blood pressure medications</li>
<li>Heart attack</li>
<li>Heart disease</li>
<li>Infection</li>
<li>Liver failure</li>
<li>Use of aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve, others) or related drugs</li>
<li>Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)</li>
<li>Severe burns</li>
<li>Severe dehydration</li>
</ul>  
<h5>Damage to the kidneys</h5>      
<i><p>These diseases, conditions and agents may damage the kidneys and lead to acute kidney failure:</p></i>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Blood clots in the veins and arteries in and around the kidneys</p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <p> Blood clots in the veins and arteries in and around the kidneys</p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <p>Medications, such as certain chemotherapy drugs, antibiotics and dyes used during imaging tests </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <p>Scleroderma, a group of rare diseases affecting the skin and connective tissues
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Scleroderma, a group of rare diseases affecting the skin and connective tissues </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <p>Not producing enough of a hormone secreted by your pancreas (insulin) or not responding to insulin
                    properly causes your body's blood sugar levels to rise, increasing your risk of a heart attack.
            </li>
            </p>
        </ul>
        <h3>Risk factors</h3>
        <p>
            <i>Acute kidney failure almost always occurs in connection with another medical condition or event. Conditions that can increase your risk of acute kidney failure include:</i>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Being hospitalized, especially for a serious condition that requires intensive care
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Advanced age,High blood pressure
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Blockages in the blood vessels in your arms or legs (peripheral artery disease),Heart failure
                Kidney diseases,Liver diseases
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Complications</h3>
        <p>  Potential complications of acute kidney failure include:</p>
        <strong>
            Fluid buildup
        </strong>
        <p>Acute kidney failure may lead to a buildup of fluid in your lungs, which can cause shortness of breath.</p>
        
        <strong>
            Chest pain
        </strong>
        <p>
            If the lining that covers your heart (pericardium) becomes inflamed, you may experience chest pain.
        </p>
        <strong>Muscle weakness.</strong>
        <p>When your body's fluids and electrolytes — your body's blood chemistry — are out of balance, muscle weakness can result.</p>
        
        <p>Occasionally, acute kidney failure causes permanent loss of kidney function, or end-stage renal disease. People with end-stage renal disease require either permanent dialysis — a mechanical filtration process used to remove toxins and wastes from the body — or a kidney transplant to survive.</p>
