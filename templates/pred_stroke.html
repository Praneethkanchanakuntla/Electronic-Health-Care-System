    <p>
      An ischemic stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, preventing brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. Brain cells begin to die in minutes.

      A stroke is a medical emergency, and prompt treatment is crucial. Early action can reduce brain damage and other complications.
      
      The good news is that many fewer Americans die of stroke now than in the past. Effective treatments can also help prevent disability from stroke.
    </p>
  <h3>Symptoms</h3>
    <p>
      If you or someone you're with may be having a stroke, pay particular attention to the time the symptoms began. Some treatment options are most effective when given soon after a stroke begins.
    </p>
  <i>
    <p>
      Signs and symptoms of stroke include:
    </p></i>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>rouble speaking and understanding what others are saying.</strong><p>You may experience confusion, slur words or have difficulty understanding speech.</p></li>
       <li><strong>Paralysis or numbness of the face, arm or leg.</strong><p>You may develop sudden numbness, weakness or paralysis in the face, arm or leg. This often affects just one side of the body. Try to raise both your arms over your head at the same time. If one arm begins to fall, you may be having a stroke. Also, one side of your mouth may droop when you try to smile.</p></li>  
       <li><strong>Problems seeing in one or both eyes.</strong><p>You may suddenly have blurred or blackened vision in one or both eyes, or you may see double.</p></li>  
       <li><strong>Headache. </strong><p>A sudden, severe headache, which may be accompanied by vomiting, dizziness or altered consciousness, may indicate that you're having a stroke.</p></li>
       <li><strong>Trouble walking. </strong><p>You may stumble or lose your balance. You may also have sudden dizziness or a loss of coordination.</p></li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Causes</h3>
    <p>There are two main causes of stroke: a blocked artery (ischemic stroke) or leaking or bursting of a blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke). Some people may have only a temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain, known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA), that doesn't cause lasting symptoms.</p>
 <h5>Ischemic stroke</h5>
 </div>
 <div class="clearfix">
  <img src="https://www.mayoclinic.org/-/media/kcms/gbs/patient-consumer/images/2014/10/29/13/33/r7_ischemicstroke.jpg" class="col-md-6 float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3" alt="...">
  <p>This is the most common type of stroke. It happens when the brain's blood vessels become narrowed or blocked, causing severely reduced blood flow (ischemia). Blocked or narrowed blood vessels are caused by fatty deposits that build up in blood vessels or by blood clots or other debris that travel through the bloodstream, most often from the heart, and lodge in the blood vessels in the brain.</p>
  <h5>
    Hemorrhagic stroke
  </h5>
  <p>Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain leaks or ruptures. Brain hemorrhages can result from many conditions that affect the blood vessels. Factors related to hemorrhagic stroke include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Uncontrolled high blood pressure    </li>
    <li>Overtreatment with blood thinners (anticoagulants)</li>
    <li>Bulges at weak spots in your blood vessel walls (aneurysms)</li>
    <li>Trauma (such as a car accident)</li>
    <li>Protein deposits in blood vessel walls that lead to weakness in the vessel wall (cerebral amyloid angiopathy)</li>
    <li>Ischemic stroke leading to hemorrhage</li>

  </ul>
  <h4> Risk factors</h4>
 <i><p>Many factors can increase the risk of stroke. Potentially treatable stroke risk factors include:</p></i>
 <h6>Lifestyle risk factors</h6>
 <ul>
   <li>Being overweight or obese </li>
   <li> Physical inactivity </li>
   <li>Heavy or binge drinking</li>
   <li> Use of illegal drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine</li>
 </ul>
 <h6>Medical risk factors</h6>
 <ul>
   <li>High blood pressure</li>
   <li>Cigarette smoking or secondhand smoke exposure</li>
   <li>High cholesterol</li>
   <li>Diabetes</li>
   <li>Cardiovascular disease, including heart failure, heart defects, heart infection or irregular heart rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation</li>
 </ul>
 <i><p>Other factors associated with a higher risk of stroke include:</p></i>
 <ul>
 <li><strong>Age</strong><p> People age 55 or older have a higher risk of stroke than do younger peo</p></li>
 <li><strong>Race or ethnicity  </strong><p>African Americans and Hispanics have a higher risk of stroke than do people of other races or ethnicities.</p></li>
 <li><strong>Sex  </strong><p>Men have a higher risk of stroke than do women. Women are usually older when they have strokes, and they're more likely to die of strokes than are men.</p></li>
 <li><strong>Hormones </strong><p>Use of birth control pills or hormone therapies that include estrogen increases risk.
</p></li>
</ul>


<h5>Complications</h5>
<i><p>A stroke can sometimes cause temporary or permanent disabilities, depending on how long the brain lacks blood flow and which part is affected. Complications may include:</p></i>
<ul>
<strong>Paralysis or loss of muscle movement </strong> <p>You may become paralyzed on one side of the body, or lose control of certain muscles, such as those on one side of the face or one arm.
</p><strong>Difficulty talking or swallowing </strong> <p>A stroke might affect control of the muscles in the mouth and throat, making it difficult for you to talk clearly, swallow or eat. You also may have difficulty with language, including speaking or understanding speech, reading, or writing.
</p><strong>Memory loss or thinking difficulties</strong><p> Many people who have had strokes experience some memory loss. Others may have difficulty thinking, reasoning, making judgments and understanding concepts.
</p><strong>Emotional problems</strong><p> People who have had strokes may have more difficulty controlling their emotions, or they may develop depression.
</p><strong>Pain</strong> <p>Pain, numbness or other unusual sensations may occur in the parts of the body affected by stroke. For example, if a stroke causes you to lose feeling in the left arm, you may develop an uncomfortable tingling sensation in that arm.
</p><strong>Changes in behavior and self-care ability.</strong><p> People who have had strokes may become more withdrawn. They may need help with grooming and daily chores.
</p></ul>
